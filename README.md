# CUB3D

This is a minigame like doom, that I made with my friend @Gbriel70. We used RayCasting to make that, and the language C.

Some rules of the game:
* WASD to move, QE or Left/Right directional keys to rotate camera
* ESC to quit
* Textures or colors for each sides (North, South, West, East) and Sky/Floor
* Shadows based on the distance
* Animation sprite
* Minimap



## How to use
```bash
git clone git@github.com:gabrielbastossobral/CUB3D.git
```
After git clone, you must to do make push to bring the libraries libft and mlx
```bash
make push
```
And now just use make and use the program with a valid map
```bash
./cub3d ./maps/path_map
```
